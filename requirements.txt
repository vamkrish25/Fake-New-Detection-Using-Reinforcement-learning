!pip install keras-rectified-adam--0.20.0 #It is used to install the Keras Rectified Adam (RAdam) optimizer in a Python environment using the pip package manager. 
import pandas as pd==1.4.4 # It is used to import the pandas library in a Python. It is used for data manipulation and analysis in Python. 
import csv==1.0# It used to import the csv module in a Python environment. provides functionality for working with CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. 
import tensorflow as tf# It is used to import the TensorFlow library in a Python environment and create an alias tf for it. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library. 
import numpy as np==1.23.5# It is used to import the NumPy library in a Python environment and create an alias np. NumPy is a popular library for numerical computing in Python.
pip install matplotlib==3.5.2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #import the `pyplot` module from the `matplotlib` library, and assign it the alias name `plt`. You can then use `plt` as a shorthand for `matplotlib.pyplot` in your code, just like you would with any other version of the library.
import sklearn==1.0.2 ## The above line imports the `sklearn` (also known as scikit-learn) library, which is a powerful and popular Python library for machine learning. It provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and more.
